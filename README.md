# Memory-fault-prediction
Key words: SVM, regression, classification, memory error, corrected errors, python

Description of project:  This is a three-classes classification problem. The project uses SVM algorithm to classificate the memory error data in order to predict the fault rate of the specific DIMM in the future.

language environment: python 2.7.14

platform: Windows/Linux
